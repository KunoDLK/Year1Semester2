Risk Assessment Outline:

- Outdated Operating Systems: The use of Windows 7 SP2 is a concern as it has reached end of life and is no longer receiving security updates.
- Weak Authentication: The use of a single 15 character password for key network services is not strong enough and makes the system vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- Use of Telnet: The use of telnet for remote access to network equipment is not secure and should be replaced with more secure protocols like SSH.
- Lack of Network Segmentation: Class-based IPv4 subnets are not efficient in terms of security as they do not provide enough network segmentation which could lead to unauthorized access to critical resources.

- Lack of Security Updates: Open-source software may contain security holes that can be exploited by attackers if not updated regularly.
- Use of RIP v1: Routing Information Protocol (RIP) v1 is an outdated and insecure protocol that should be replaced with a more secure routing protocol
- Main and back-up servers are located on the ground floor
